# Changes

## 2.0.0-beta.7 - 2025-07-07

* Update capitalization of "uint" in `ReadUInt*` to match `KindUint*` as well
  as the Go standard library.

## 2.0.0-beta.6 - 2025-07-07

* Invalid release with no code changes.

## 2.0.0-beta.5 - 2025-07-06

- Added `Offset()` method to `Decoder` to get the current database offset. This
  enables custom unmarshalers to implement caching for improved performance when
  loading databases with duplicate data structures.
- Fixed infinite recursion in pointer-to-pointer data structures, which are
  invalid per the MaxMind DB specification.

## 2.0.0-beta.4 - 2025-07-05

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed experimental `deserializer` interface and
  supporting code. Applications using this interface should migrate to the
  `Unmarshaler` interface by implementing `UnmarshalMaxMindDB(d *Decoder) error`
  instead.
- `Open` and `FromBytes` now accept options.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `IncludeNetworksWithoutData` and `IncludeAliasedNetworks`
  now return a `NetworksOption` rather than being one themselves. These must now
  be called as functions: `Networks(IncludeAliasedNetworks())` instead of
  `Networks(IncludeAliasedNetworks)`. This was done to improve the documentation
  organization.
- Added `Unmarshaler` interface to allow custom decoding implementations for
  performance-critical applications. Types implementing
  `UnmarshalMaxMindDB(d *Decoder) error` will automatically use custom decoding
  logic instead of reflection, following the same pattern as
  `json.Unmarshaler`.
- Added public `Decoder` type and `Kind` constants in `mmdbdata` package for
  manual decoding. `Decoder` provides methods like `ReadMap()`, `ReadSlice()`,
  `ReadString()`, `ReadUInt32()`, `PeekKind()`, etc. `Kind` type includes
  helper methods `String()`, `IsContainer()`, and `IsScalar()` for type
  introspection. The main `maxminddb` package re-exports these types for
  backward compatibility. `NewDecoder()` supports an options pattern for
  future extensibility.
- Enhanced `UnmarshalMaxMindDB` to work with nested struct fields, slice
  elements, and map values. The custom unmarshaler is now called recursively
  for any type that implements the `Unmarshaler` interface, similar to
  `encoding/json`.
- Improved error messages to include byte offset information and, for the
  reflection-based API, path information for nested structures using JSON
  Pointer format. For example, errors may now show "at offset 1234, path
  /city/names/en" or "at offset 1234, path /list/0/name" instead of just the
  underlying error message.
- **PERFORMANCE**: Added string interning optimization that reduces allocations
  while maintaining thread safety. Reduces allocation count from 33 to 10 per
  operation in downstream libraries. Uses a fixed 512-entry cache with per-entry
  mutexes for bounded memory usage (~8KB) while minimizing lock contention.

## 2.0.0-beta.3 - 2025-02-16

- `Open` will now fall back to loading the database in memory if the
  file-system does not support `mmap`. Pull request by database64128. GitHub
  #163.
- Made significant improvements to the Windows memory-map handling. GitHub
  #162.
- Fix an integer overflow on large databases when using a 32-bit architecture.
  See ipinfo/mmdbctl#33.

## 2.0.0-beta.2 - 2024-11-14

- Allow negative indexes for arrays when using `DecodePath`. #152
- Add `IncludeNetworksWithoutData` option for `Networks` and `NetworksWithin`.
  #155 and #156

## 2.0.0-beta.1 - 2024-08-18

This is the first beta of the v2 releases. Go 1.23 is required. I don't expect
to do a final release until Go 1.24 is available. See #141 for the v2 roadmap.

Notable changes:

- `(*Reader).Lookup` now takes only the IP address and returns a `Result`.
  `Lookup(ip, &rec)` would now become `Lookup(ip).Decode(&rec)`.
- `(*Reader).LookupNetwork` has been removed. To get the network for a result,
  use `(Result).Prefix()`.
- `(*Reader).LookupOffset` now _takes_ an offset and returns a `Result`.
  `Result` has an `Offset()` method that returns the offset value.
  `(*Reader).Decode` has been removed.
- Use of `net.IP` and `*net.IPNet` have been replaced with `netip.Addr` and
  `netip.Prefix`.
- You may now decode a particular path within a database record using
  `(Result).DecodePath`. For instance, to decode just the country code in
  GeoLite2 Country to a string called `code`, you might do something like
  `Lookup(ip).DecodePath(&code, "country", "iso_code")`. Strings should be used
  for map keys and ints for array indexes.
- `(*Reader).Networks` and `(*Reader).NetworksWithin` now return a Go 1.23
  iterator of `Result` values. Aliased networks are now skipped by default. If
  you wish to include them, use the `IncludeAliasedNetworks` option.

## 1.13.1 - 2024-06-28

- Return the `*net.IPNet` in canonical form when using `NetworksWithin` to look
  up a network more specific than the one in the database. Previously, the `IP`
  field on the `*net.IPNet` would be set to the IP from the lookup network
  rather than the first IP of the network.
- `NetworksWithin` will now correctly handle an `*net.IPNet` parameter that is
  not in canonical form. This issue would only occur if the `*net.IPNet` was
  manually constructed, as `net.ParseCIDR` returns the value in canonical form
  even if the input string is not.

## 1.13.0 - 2024-06-03

- Go 1.21 or greater is now required.
- The error messages when decoding have been improved. #119

## 1.12.0 - 2023-08-01

- The `wasi` target is now built without memory-mapping support. Pull request
  by Alex Kashintsev. GitHub #114.
- When decoding to a map of non-scalar, non-interface types such as a
  `map[string]map[string]any`, the decoder failed to zero out the value for the
  map elements, which could result in incorrect decoding. Reported by JT Olio.
  GitHub #115.

## 1.11.0 - 2023-06-18

- `wasm` and `wasip1` targets are now built without memory-mapping support.
  Pull request by Randy Reddig. GitHub #110.

**Full Changelog**:
https://github.com/oschwald/maxminddb-golang/compare/v1.10.0...v1.11.0

## 1.10.0 - 2022-08-07

- Set Go version in go.mod file to 1.18.

## 1.9.0 - 2022-03-26

- Set the minimum Go version in the go.mod file to 1.17.
- Updated dependencies.
- Minor performance improvements to the custom deserializer feature added in
  1.8.0.

## 1.8.0 - 2020-11-23

- Added `maxminddb.SkipAliasedNetworks` option to `Networks` and
  `NetworksWithin` methods. When set, this option will cause the iterator to
  skip networks that are aliases of the IPv4 tree.
- Added experimental custom deserializer support. This allows much more control
  over the deserialization. The API is subject to change and you should use at
  your own risk.

## 1.7.0 - 2020-06-13

- Add `NetworksWithin` method. This returns an iterator that traverses all
  networks in the database that are contained in the given network. Pull
  request by Olaf Alders. GitHub #65.

## 1.6.0 - 2019-12-25

- This module now uses Go modules. Requested by Matthew Rothenberg. GitHub #49.
- Plan 9 is now supported. Pull request by Jacob Moody. GitHub #61.
- Documentation fixes. Pull request by Olaf Alders. GitHub #62.
- Thread-safety is now mentioned in the documentation. Requested by Ken
  Sedgwick. GitHub #39.
- Fix off-by-one error in file offset safety check. Reported by Will Storey.
  GitHub #63.

## 1.5.0 - 2019-09-11

- Drop support for Go 1.7 and 1.8.
- Minor performance improvements.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-08-28

- Add the method `LookupNetwork`. This returns the network that the record
  belongs to as well as a boolean indicating whether there was a record for the
  IP address in the database. GitHub #59.
- Improve performance.

## 1.3.1 - 2019-08-28

- Fix issue with the finalizer running too early on Go 1.12 when using the
  Verify method. Reported by Robert-Andr√© Mauchin. GitHub #55.
- Remove unnecessary call to reflect.ValueOf. PR by SenseyeDeveloper. GitHub
  #53.

## 1.3.0 - 2018-02-25

- The methods on the `maxminddb.Reader` struct now return an error if called on
  a closed database reader. Previously, this could cause a segmentation
  violation when using a memory-mapped file.
- The `Close` method on the `maxminddb.Reader` struct now sets the underlying
  buffer to nil, even when using `FromBytes` or `Open` on Google App Engine.
- No longer uses constants from `syscall`

## 1.2.1 - 2018-01-03

- Fix incorrect index being used when decoding into anonymous struct fields. PR
  #42 by Andy Bursavich.

## 1.2.0 - 2017-05-05

- The database decoder now does bound checking when decoding data from the
  database. This is to help ensure that the reader does not panic when given a
  corrupt database to decode. Closes #37.
- The reader will now return an error on a data structure with a depth greater
  than 512. This is done to prevent the possibility of a stack overflow on a
  cyclic data structure in a corrupt database. This matches the maximum depth
  allowed by `libmaxminddb`. All MaxMind databases currently have a depth of
  less than five.

## 1.1.0 - 2016-12-31

- Added appengine build tag for Windows. When enabled, memory-mapping will be
  disabled in the Windows build as it is for the non-Windows build. Pull
  request #35 by Ingo Oeser.
- SetFinalizer is now used to unmap files if the user fails to close the
  reader. Using `r.Close()` is still recommended for most use cases.
- Previously, an unsafe conversion between `[]byte` and string was used to
  avoid unnecessary allocations when decoding struct keys. The decoder now
  relies on a compiler optimization on `string([]byte)` map lookups to achieve
  this rather than using `unsafe`.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-11-09

New release for those using tagged releases.
